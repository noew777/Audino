Here you can find several experiments developed with ATMEGA328p microcontroller, the same one used in Arduino R3. All programs are written using registers-level code. In addition, a bash that compile and upload codes into a board is included in order to be able to code without the need for an IDE. All you need is the microcontroller's utility (avrdude in this case; includes compiler, linker...) and a text editor to type your own programs.
